As I was working on my SE/30, I knew I didn't want to go with a SCSI hard drive. I started looking online and came across the SCSI2SD. I purchased mine with a 256MB SD card from Inertial Computing on eBay. Now that it is up and running, I'm very happy with it.

When using with an older Macintosh, you may have an issue when it comes to initializing and using a non-Apple drive. The first time, Apple HD SC Setup wouldn't find the drive. I then found this forum post. I followed dougg3's directions when setting up the SCSI2SD.

Set the vendor to the string " SEAGATE" (yes, there is a single space in front of SEAGATE for a total of 8 characters)
Set the product ID to the string " ST225N" (10 spaces in front for a total of 16 characters)
Set the revision to the string "1.0 " (with a space after, for a total of 4 characters)
Apple HD SC Setup then saw the drive. The other thing I had to do was re-partition the drive after it set it up, since Apple HD SC Setup only create a 16MB partition and left the rest of the drive unpartitioned. I deleted that partition and then created a 256MB partition.
